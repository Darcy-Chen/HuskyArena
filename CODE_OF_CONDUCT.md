# Code of Conduct

We value the safety of our community and welcome contributors of all types. 
Everyone has the freedom to join the community without fear of any personal and 
unwarranted attacks. However, we want to delay the establishment of strict 
requirements because unnecessary seriousness harms the growth of the project 
during the early stage. With that being said, please behave professionally, have 
empathy for others, and be excellent to each other.
